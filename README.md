# TERMTRIVIA

TermTrivia is a simple CLI app and server that offers Computer Science questions that are locally stored. Future releases will include dynamic question generation as well as different topics.

Term Trivia's server was built using my own framework called [Pine](https://github.com/BryanMwangi/pine). Please feel free to give it a star if you like it.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to make sure that the server is running. There minimum requirements are:

- Go 1.18+

Go ahead and clone this repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BryanMwangi/termtrivia.git
```

### Set up

The app and the cli are not built. You will need to either build them by getting into each directory and running `go build` or you can run them directly from the terminal.

```bash
cd termtrivia/server

go run main.go
```

or

```bash
go run .
```

Do the same for the CLI app.

```bash
cd termtrivia/cliapp

go run main.go
```

or

```bash
go run .
```

## Usage

After setting up, please enjoy the game and you can use the cli app to play the game. Just start the app and follow the instructions.
